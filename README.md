**Interests**: Deep Learning, Compilers (e.g., Polyhedral Compilation), HPC, etc.‚Äîbasically anything related to high-level programming techniques that empower modern LLM algorithm developers. I'm interested in bridging theoretical concepts with practical implementations!

**Projects**:

- :rocket: [**TileFusion**](https://github.com/microsoft/TileFusion) is <ins>*an experimental C++ macro kernel template library that raises the abstraction level of CUDA C for tile processing*</ins>. The project aims to offer a higher-level interface that enables algorithm developers to innovate hardware-aware LLM algorithms without getting bogged down by low-level hardware details.

- üß© [**FractalTensor**](https://github.com/microsoft/FractalTensor) is <ins>*a programming framework*</ins> that introduces the concept of FractalTensor‚Äîa list of statically shaped tensors arranged in nested lists, associated with advanced functional array compute operators like map, reduce, and scan, as well as array access operators.
  
  This project involves DSL and IR work, inspired by polyhedral-style loop program analysis. After completing the research [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3694715.3695961), I have to plan to resume work on FractalTensor following the TileFusion project, a side project derived from this research.

- üîç [**VPTQ**](https://github.com/microsoft/VPTQ) <ins>*Introducing VPTQ ‚Äì an extreme low-bit quantization algorithm and inference library*</ins> designed for large language models (LLMs). Developed by my talented friend @[YangWang92](https://github.com/YangWang92), this project offers an innovative approach to quantizing LLMs. I'm happy to contribute, both to explore my own research interests and to gain hands-on experience with innovative algorithmic ideas.
